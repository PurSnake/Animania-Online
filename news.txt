Hello Chat!
Welcome to our Streamer build funny man from bopcity! (DO THE TWERK OF 87 - Niko)
We hope the wait (for a year) was worth it!
All of us recommend you go to freeplay to play our songs, as we don't have cutscenes yet!

We hope you have a exciting Stream of our mod!

Love you guys! - Animania Team
