We have been working on this for awhile now! (mainly working on reworking old stuff, uhhhh)

Shout out to Penkaru for streaming the streamer build, was a early preview to the full mod, but now you guys get to play it in full!
(Overall we wish the best for you all, support penkaru aswell! he's been through alot, tell him Niko has sent you!)

Join our discord server! we will be posting updates, teasers and more!

I have nothing to say! enjoy Animania!
